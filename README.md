# 🐒 Baboon API Visualization Website

So... I made a Baboon API. But **why the heck did I do that?** 🤔  
Well, too late now—it exists ! \o/

And to show the world how it works, I was craving to make a visualizer.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
This frontend was made using :
- [**Vite**](https://vite.dev/) + [**Vue 3**](https://vuejs.org/) (Composition API) + [**TypeScript**](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [**Swiper**](https://swiperjs.com/element) for the carousel
- [**SASS**](https://sass-lang.com/) for styling

In case you too are afflicted by this strange urge to know about project's stacks ...

## 🧗‍♂️ But why a Baboon API ?
While doing an online course, I came across the usual [**Dog API**](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/) and [**Cat API**](https://thecatapi.com/) for frontend testing ... Yeah I know : LAME 🤮

So I thought: "*Why always the same animals? Lets spice things up !*" 🌶️

Since I genuinely love **baboons (and all monkeys)**, I decided to create the **Baboon API** 🐵

It was also a great excuse to play around with [**Bun**](https://bun.sh/) and [**ElysiaJS**](https://elysiajs.com/), applying some of the concepts I had just learned. I just needed a fun project to experiment on
