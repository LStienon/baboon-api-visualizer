# 🐒 Baboon API Visualization Website

So... I made a Baboon API. But **why the heck did I do that?** 🤔  
Well, too late now—it exists ! \o/

And to show the world how it works, I was craving to make a visualizer.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
This frontend was made using:
- **Vite + Vue 3 (Composition API) + TypeScript**
- **Swiper** for the carousel
- **SASS** for styling

In case you too are afflicted by this strange urge to know about project's stacks ...

## 🧗‍♂️ But why a Baboon API ?
While doing an online course, I came across the usual **Dog API** and **Cat API** for frontend testing ... Yeah I know : LAME 🤮

So I thought: "*Why always the same animals? Lets spice things up !*" 🌶️

Since I genuinely love **baboons (and all monkeys)**, I decided to create the **Baboon API** 🐵

It was also a great excuse to play around with **Bun** and **ElysiaJS**, applying some of the concepts I had just learned. I just needed a fun project to experiment on
